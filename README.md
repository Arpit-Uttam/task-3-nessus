# NESSUS VULNERABILITY SCANNER
#Vulnerability Assessment (VA):
Vulnerability Assessment (VA) is the process of finding weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in a system, network, or application before attackers can exploit them. It helps organizations understand their security risks and take steps to fix them.

# Role of Nessus
It automates scanning No need to check every system manually.
It finds vulnerabilities fast Scans thousands of systems in a short time.
It provides detailed reports Shows weaknesses and how to fix them.
It's trusted worldwide Used by companies, governments, and security experts.

# Nessus scans
#Basic Network Scan
This is the most common and easiest Nessus scan.
It scans a network for common vulnerabilities, open ports, and misconfigurations.
Requires minimal configuration-just select the scan, enter the target IPs, and run it.

#Discovery Scan
This scan helps find all devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) connected to a network.
It doesn't check for vulnerabilities-it just identifies what's there.
Helps security teams know what devices are in their network.
Detects unauthorized devices (e.g., an unknown laptop connected to your Wi-Fi).

#Advanced scan
This scan allows full customization, making it powerful for penetration testers.
You can choose specific plugins, scan depth, authentication methods, and more.
Provides more accurate results than a Basic Network Scan.

->When to Use It?
When you need a detailed and customizable scan.
For internal penetration testing (authenticated scans provide deeper insights).
When scanning specific systems or services (e.g., only web servers)

#Authentication Vulnerability scan
In a normal vulnerability scan, Nessus checks for security weaknesses without logging into the target system.
Authenticated scanning means Nessus logs into the system with valid credentials (like a username and password) to scan deeper.
It allows Nessus to check inside the system, not just from the outside.
